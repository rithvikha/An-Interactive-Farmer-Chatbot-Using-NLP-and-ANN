# An-Interactive-Farmer-Chatbot-Using-NLP-and-ANN
The agricultural sector plays a crucial role in ensuring food security and sustain- able development. However, 
farmers face several challenges, such as weather uncertainty, market volatility, and crop diseases, which can 
affect their yields and in- comes. To address these challenges, there is a need for innovative solutions that can 
help farmers make informed decisions and improve their agricultural practices. In order to answer the queries of 
the farmer, agricultural Chatbot can be designed. The system “Farmer Chatbot” overcomes the problem and provides 
farmers the better opportunity to obtain the desired information and to scale up with upcoming market trends and 
technologies in a user friendly manner. The proposed system is a chat bot, which is a virtual conversational 
assistant, through which the users can communicate with the bot as if they are conversing with humans. The focus 
is on developing the bot in a more intellectual way, that it can even recognize not so well grammatically defined 
sentences, misspelled words, incomplete phrases, etc. This can help people to converse easily with the bot, since 
this system uses the Natural Language Pro- cessing(NLP) technique using NLTK library to parse the user queries, 
identify the keywords, match them with Knowledge Base and respond with the accurate results.
